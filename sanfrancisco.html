                            This city holds history. It was originally named Yerba Buena when the area was owned by Mexico. The name 
                            changed when the<br> United States acquired the land in 1846. Many tourists enjoy visiting for vacation. One stop that 
                            seems to make everyone’s list is<br> the Golden Gate Bridge. The bridge was built in four years in 1937 and painted in 
                            the color: International Orange. On a trip to<br> the city, Mark Twain described it as, “The coldest winter I ever spent 
                            was a summer in San Francisco.” Some of the tourists are<br> well-known actors, directors, artists, and icons. Lee
                            Jun-Fan or more commonly known as Bruce Lee was born in the city, who then<br> grew up to be a world famous 
                            actor, director, martial artist, and philosopher. Alongside famous people, San Francisco is the<br> home of multiple 
                            inventions. Some of which include: denim jeans, slot machines, jukeboxes, bendy straws, martinis, popsicles,<br> 
                            fortune cookies, electric tvs, and the water bed.
