                            This city holds history. It was originally named Yerba Buena when the area was owned by Mexico. The name 
                            changed when the United States acquired the land in 1846. Many tourists enjoy visiting for vacation. One stop that 
                            seems to make everyone’s list is the Golden Gate Bridge. The bridge was built in four years in 1937 and painted in 
                            the color: International Orange. On a trip to the city, Mark Twain described it as, “The coldest winter I ever spent 
                            was a summer in San Francisco.” Some of the tourists are well-known actors, directors, artists, and icons. Lee
                            Jun-Fan or more commonly known as Bruce Lee was born in the city, who then grew up to be a world famous 
                            actor, director, martial artist, and philosopher. Alongside famous people, San Francisco is the home of multiple 
                            inventions. Some of which include: denim jeans, slot machines, jukeboxes, bendy straws, martinis, popsicles, 
                            fortune cookies, electric tvs, and the water bed.
